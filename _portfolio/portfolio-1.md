I wish you and your family safety in these testing times. I wanted to better understand the situation in New York so I created this visualization. Broken down by area code you may see tests, confirmed cases, and other covid-19 metrics provided by <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data">NYC Health Data</a>
